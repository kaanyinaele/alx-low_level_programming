Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms in C language. Each algorithm is designed to search for a specific value within an array, adhering to different principles of efficiency and complexity.
Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

    0x1E-search_algorithms/
        0-linear.c: Implements the linear search algorithm to find a value in an array with time complexity O(n)O(n).
        1-binary.c: Implements the binary search algorithm to find a value in a sorted array with time complexity O(log⁡n)O(logn).
        2-O: Discusses the time complexity (worst-case) of linear search.
        3-O: Discusses the space complexity (worst-case) of iterative linear search.
        4-O: Discusses the time complexity (worst-case) of binary search.
        5-O: Discusses the space complexity (worst-case) of binary search.
        6-O: Discusses the space complexity of a function for dynamically allocating a 2D array.
